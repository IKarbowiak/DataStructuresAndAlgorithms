# Explanation & time and space complexity analysis

## Explanation
To find smallest and largest integer from a list of unsorted integers I decided to 
iterate through list and keep info about current max and min value.

## Time complexity
Time complexity of my solution is O(n), where n is number of elements in list.
I iterate through every element in list once.

## Space complexity
Space complexity is O(1). I only keep information about min and max value, so space
complexity is constant.
